EVTNAME992271;Ukrainian Breadbasket;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992271;The Ukrainian Breadbasket begins firing in 1860. It will apply province modifers that give 0.1% pop growth permanently to all provinces in the following states: Rovne, Kiev, Cherson, Crimea, Poltava. Anyone who owns this land will recieve the Breadbasket events applying the province modifiers to the land. The Ukrainian Breadbasket is Russia's main source of pop growth when it fires and is integral to Russia's position as a late game superpower.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992272;Japanese Korean Stating;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992272;When Japan annexes Korea it will trigger a chain event which will immediately make Korea into states for Japan. This is done because Japan now starts civilized. This chain can fire at any point of the game so long as Japan takes all of Korea, it will have no effect if Korea was annexed by Japan after it was civilized.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992273;Immigration System;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992273;The immigration system in CoRGI currently rotates each month. This means that one month North America will receive all the immigrants while South America gets none and then the next month, South America will receive all the immigrants while North America gets none. The only exception to this rule is the USA, who recieves immigration during both periods.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992274;Italian Formation;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992274;Italian formation in CoRGI is currently under a Victory Point system. What this means is that to form Italy you must control more Victory Provinces than your rival. The 5 victory provinces are: Turin, Modena, Florence, Rome, Naples. Depending on the date you will need more or less VP's under your control. To form Italy in 1845 you must control all 5 VP's, after 1850 you need 4 VP's, after 1855 you need 3 VP's and after 1860 you need 2 VP's to form and your rival may not have 2 VP's either. Whoever forms Italy out of the Two Sicilies or Sardinia-Piedmont will annex all other Italian minors and change country to Italy. This will happen regardless of whether there is a player on the rival country or not. There is no other way to form Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992275;Prussian Lapse;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992275;The Prussian Lapse is an event chain that exists for Prussia. This event chain will slowly annex North Germans that are Prussian spherelings to Prussia overtime. It is completely randomised how long it will take and the North Germans that are annexed are randomised. German minors under 125,000 pops are annexed much faster than ones that are above 125,000 pops. The mean time to happen for these events will be reduced up to 1860. You can at any time eat North Germans through normal wars as well. The lapse does not apply to any South German nations or spherelings of other nations. The 'Further Political Integration in Northern Germany' decision that Prussia has will annex a random German minor for 5 infamy. It will only work for German minors that have been in your sphere for 10 years. If you fire this decision and you have not had a minor in your sphere for 10 years it will do nothing and you will not get infamy back! ;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992276;Portugal-Brazil Formation;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992276;In CoRGI Portugal may form Portugal Brazil. To do so they require the states of Pernambuco, Bahia and Rio De Janeiro. This has the potential to drastically change diplomacy in South America, depending on whether Spain is helping Portugal or not but even if they aren't it should be noted for the players in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992277;Chinese Economic Zone Nations;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992277;In CoRGI there are Chinese treaty port nations. These are substates of China that will go into a countries sphere if they own the accompanying treaty port. They instantly civilize upon a country taking the treaty port and will go into that countries sphere while remaining a substate. In the event a secondary power owns the treaty port, it will go into its sphereleaders sphere and civilize. In the event of this not existing it will remain as is. These are nations that you can invest in and they provide secure goods. There is no other way of sphering the economic zones without owning the treaty port itself.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992278;Combat;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992278;In CoRGI combat is balanced between attack and defence. This means that attack and defence stats when you have all the horizontal row of tech. This diverges from Vanilla where combat is defence oriented. In CoRGI attacking is viable and close to equal as forts give defence bonuses obviously. CoRGI overall has less mobilised troops than vanilla due to the removal of national values giving mobilisation size. Artillery is the most superior unit and should be mass built provided you can supply it. Tech wise it shoul be noted that Army Doctrine tech inventions give solely defence unit stat additions while Light Armament gives solely attack unit inventions. In CoRGI planes and tanks late game should be replacing artilllery and infantry respectively.,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992279;Supply/Reinforcement Information;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992279;Because of the way the game's supply system works not having 100% supply is devastating to reinforcement. It is for this reason it is incredibly important to make sure you can 100% supply your army otherwise you will lack reinforcement. If you reinforce 50% you will only get 50% reinforcement for the first unit and then a diminishing 50% for each sequesential unit. The first brigade may reinforce 900 the next 450 after that 225 and so on. This is why not having 100% supply is devastating.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992280;World Bank;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992280;In CoRGI there is a world bank which replaces the function of gold. This serves as the games method of pumping money into the economy. The world bank will buy all excess of the following goods: Iron, Coal, Cotton, Wool, Silk, Sulphur, Cattle, Fish, Fruit, Grain, Timber, Tropical Wood, Tobacco, Tea, Coffee, Opium, Rubber and Oil. It will permanently buy this throughout the game. The world bank is handled completely passively through the Host and Ghost nations. The world bank is the reason why those mentioned goods look like they have infinite demand. The world bank will gradually turn off at certain intervals if the money in the top 20 nations treasuies is above certain amounts. This is CoRGI deflation system which aims to keep control of the late game hyper inflation. The deflation should begin to kick in at around 1900*.;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME992281;Naval System;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992281;CoRGI uses a no naval cap system for navy. In this version of no naval cap, you must have 100% supply in order to not attrition!!!! It also uses a custom supply system which uses three just four naval goods. Frigates - Commerce Raiders all use the Early Convoys to supply. Early Dockyard factories have input requirements of Fabric, Artillery, Canned Food and Steel. This is so as to closely mirror the amount of goods required previously for the ships in this era of navy as close as possible. Ironclads - Cruisers all use the Medium Convoys to supply. Medium Dockyard factories have input requirements of Coal, Artillery, Canned Food and Steel. This is done to closely mirror the amount of goods used in this era of navy as close as possible.;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC9922811;You will unlock Medium Dockyards to build through the Steamers tech. Battleships - Dreadnoughts require the Late Convoys. Late Dockyard factories have input requirements of: Fuel, Steel, Canned Food, Artillery. The Late Dockyard factory will be unlocked through the Iron Steamers tech. Clipper and Steamer transports use the Transport Convoy good. The Transport Convoy factories have input requirements of Fabric, Timber, Lumber and Steel. Steamer Transports use 3x the supply than clipper transports even though they use the same good. The consumption of all ships is closely mirrored as to how it was in previous versions of CoRGI. ;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992282;Migration/Emigration;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992282;Pops migrate based on their life needs, militancy and unemployment. Scaling levels of each of these factors will result in more internal migration in addition to emigration. In CoRGI War Exhaustion will also affect emigration, with scaling levels of emigration as your war exhaustion goes up.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992283;Immigration System;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992283;The immigration system in CoRGI currently rotates each month. This means that one month North America will receive all the immigrants while South America gets none and then the next month, South America will receive all the immigrants while North America gets none. The only exception to this rule is the USA, who recieves immigration during both periods.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992284;Money Techs*;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992284;In CoRGI there are 5 important techs that are considered money techs. These are: Interchangeable Parts (1845), Business Banks (1850), Inorganic Chemistry (1850), Combustion Engine (1880) and Electricity (1880). These techs have inventions that give +22% RGO output (Other IGoR based mods and this is 30%). Those inventions are color coded in blue and have a 100% base chance to be invented meaning they will be invented immediately. These techs are crucial to your economies cashflow and getting more RGO goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992285;Assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992285;In IGoR/CoRGI the assimilation system has been completely reworked. There are no double culture cores anywhere across the map meaning that assimilation can and will begin in any province once there is a seed pop (A pop of your primary culture in the province). The base speed of assimilation is universal across the board and is effected by numerous factors. The Equality national value gives a flat 50% increase to assimilation. Pops with higher literacy will assimilate faster than those with low levels of literacy. Militancy and consciousness also affect assimilation speed alongside other factors. Assimilation provides value to land that is not your core or that doesn't have a plurality of your accepted pops. The longer you hold the land the more pops you can assimilate in it. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
