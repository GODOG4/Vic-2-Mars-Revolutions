Mars Revolutions is a Total Conversion mod for Victoria 2 based on the map and lore of the 'Middle Mars' mod made by Zombaxx

The map projection is centered on the South Pole, the general premise is that Mars was terraformed and colonized but lost contact with Earth after an unspecified disaster. Now thousands of years later Industrialization has started to come back after a fleet of ships from Tau Centauri arrived.

There is some more history and lore which will be based on the original mod and a bit more will be made custom for the Vic 2 mod.

Credit to Dotdot for his Victoria 2 Map Making tools and to Zombaxx for the original CK2 mod.
