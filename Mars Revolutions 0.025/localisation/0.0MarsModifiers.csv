republican_safe_haven;Corperate Legacy;;;;;;;;;;;x
republican_safe_haven_desc;With chaos all around Mars, as thousands are displaced or languish under tyrant kings, the shimmering Isles of the Eosians ruled by a fair Corperate Republic lead by families of 'CEOs' is attracting a lot of new citizens. And most importantly: new workers!;;;;;;;;;;;x
celestial_colony;The Celestial Colonial Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celestial_colony_desc;The 'Spacers' are the remnants of a fleet of ship sent all the way from Tau Centari who wanted to investigate what happened to Earth and the Solar System. The journey was long and perilous and much of the gravity acclimating medicine was lost, so only a small population has been able to make land fall. Their government has dual focus: maintaining the colony on land and the much more important task of maintaining the much larger colony on the ship circling the planet. That has often means the Mars colony gets less attention than it should. It will take some time for them to de-couple and split the command fully should the Celestial Protectorate show promising results on Mars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##########################Religion Modifiers###########################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
holy_terra;Holy Terra;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
holy_terra_desc;Disciples of Holy Terra believe Earthlings made a garden of eden for martians and created the old Martian society in Earth's image, but was abandoned and stripped of technology by Earth for an unknown transgression. They strive to rid themselves of vices and be more like Terrans to correct this transgression, reconnect with Earth and reclaim their destiny in the stars. They are very intolerant of any opposing views on Terra, including other Singularity sects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_terra;Post Terra;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_terra_desc;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
blessed_singularity;Blessed Singularity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
blessed_singularity_desc;The Blessed Singularity shares many beliefs with Holy Terra, but believes the sun created the earth, and the singularity created the sun. Therefor even though they strive to be like Terrans they believe Martians to be equal since we are all humans that came from the singularity. They believe that Holy Terra wrongfully abandoned the emphasis on the Singularity for political rather than spiritual reasons to better control the population by making them meek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
divine_truth;Divine Truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
divine_truth_desc;Divine Truth is the oldest of the Singularity-based religions and its origins can be traced back all the way to the formation of the first kingdoms in the Western Hemisphere following the Great Disaster. The holiest city of this monotheistic faith is Argyre, which served as the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Truth. Similar to Holy Terra and Blessed Singularity, except it is impossible for Mars to reconnect with Earth on its own, only by waiting for the Messiah to arrive and take the chosen back to Earth can Truth be restored.;Le judaïsme est la plus ancienne des religions abrahamiques. On fait remonter ses origines à l'âge du bronze. La ville la plus sacrée de cette religion monothéiste est Jérusalem, qui fut la capitale de l'ancien royaume d'Israël.;Das Judentum ist die älteste der abrahamitischen Religionen, ihre Ursprünge reichen zurück bis in die Bronzezeit. Die heiligste Stadt dieser monotheistischen Religion ist Jerusalem, einst Hauptstadt des Königreichs Israel.;;;;;;;;;;;x
seaborne;Seaborne;;;;;;;;;x
seaborne_desc;When the once vast lands of Tempe Terra sank into Oceanus Borealis, leaving only the peninsula seen today, the Seaborne rose from the waters. This tragedy eventually developed into an advantage to the Seaborne, as they mastered the oceans and rivers to take what was needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kemetic;Kemetic;;;;;;;;;x
kemetic_desc;The Kemetic Tribals believe in the gods from above, worshipping both Spacer and Terraformed tech, but not the Spacers and Terraformed themselves. They hope that by gaining favor with these technologies they will gain access to the tree filled with untouched moons to enjoy the afterlife with the gods above the sky, and that they have to construct their tombs as close to the heavens and as preserved as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;x
aiti_marsilainen;Aiti Marsilainen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aiti_marsilainen_desc;Aiti Marsilainen paganism is diverse, varying a lot between tribes and regions. It is shamanistic and animist, revering a multitude of gods, including Mukko/Pertele, Nuu and, in the east, Marstor-Avo, godd of Mars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
divine_cycle;Divine Cycle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
divine_cycle_desc;The Singularity is merely the moment that each cycle of the Divine Cycle begins. Adherents of this ideology believe the disaster and being earth-like irrelevant due to the cyclical nature of the universe, though do not deny Earth's existence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
olympic;Olympic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
olympic_desc;The Olympic religion is polytheistic, with a pantheon of twelve major gods including Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Minerva and Vesta. It originated in ancient Post-Disaster Mars with the conquests of Xander the Great and the Olympian Empire, it would go on to become the dominant religion in the western Tharsis Rise until the rise of Singularity and Solarianism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vimana;Vimana;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vimana_desc;Vimanism is not a single religion so much as a blanket term for the successor beliefs of ancient astronaut theorists as recorded in the manuscripts. The existence of many different sects within Vimanism - as well as millennia of relatively peaceful co-existence with Ahimsimism and Yogism - has made the Vimana faith remarkably tolerant and pluralistic toward all Eastern religions. Still, it is the most warlike of the three.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yoghi;Yoghi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yoghi_desc;Yoghism was founded by the Yoghi, Siddhartha Gautama, in Northeast Hellas in the 4th century After the Disaster. The religion flourished in a large portion of Hellas for more than 500 years, building huge libraries and monastery complexes, until Terraformed invasions and the growing power of the Theorist caste drove Yoghism to the fringes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ahimsa;Ahimsa;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ahimsa_desc;Ahimsaism is a religion of incredible antiquity, stemming from the ascetic Sramana tradition of Hellas, in opposition to the priestly Theorists and the caste system. The guiding principle of Ahimsaism is pacifism - which is more radically interpreted than in any other religion. In the game, Ahimsas have a hard time waging offensive wars, but their remarkable tolerance means Ahimsa rulers are well liked by all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spacer;Spacer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spacer_desc;A fleet of ships from a nearby star system has arrived to investigate in the wake of the disaster. Because light travel is impossible it took this intersystem ship 1000 years to reach its destination in the Solar System.\nDue to unforseen circumstances, the crew is less prepared than would be viable to complete their mission. \nThe ship containing most of the medicine needed for Spacers to acclimate to gravity, and most of the supplies and tools needed for the mission itself, were lost. \n\nMost Spacers are left stuck in space with dwindling food, resources, and few tools beyond the cybernetic and mech manufacturing facilities. Most other fabricators and resources needed for long-term sustainable survival in space were on the lost ships of the fleet. \nThey must trade their advanced tech and knowledge, seen as magic by the majority of Martians, for food and resources in order to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mother_of_waters;Mother of Waters;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mother_of_waters_desc;Starting off as an Hesperian traditional rain dance reciting the battle between the Seas and the Storm Demon, this once Ahimsa-Yogi inspired piece has fully become a religion of its own. With the belief that Moni Mekhala is the guardian of the seas which her people depend on, believers have an expansive sea-faring and aquatic culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
escudo_solar;Escudo Solar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
escudo_solar_desc;Escudo Solarists believe the ancient king Pakal had saved the Earth from the Doom with his sun shield vessel. Humanity strayed from this sacred knowledge and neglected to stop the Doom the second time. They must be ready to stop the third impact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
animism;Animism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
animism_desc;Animism includes many of the diverse pagan beliefs of the tribes of the Solis Planum. Ancestor worship and totemistic shamanism dominate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cyrillic;Cyrillic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cyrillic_desc;Descended from the worship of deities from Earth of long ago, Cyrillic followers remember the dark forested lands and large rolling hills of tall grasses. Led by archivists who sought to keep these traditions alive through the post-Earth ages, the worship of these deities and the script of their mythological texts has combined to keep the Cyrillian faith strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
terraformed;Terraformed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
terraformed_desc;Sacred guardians of the dormant atmospheric machines, The Terraformed belive humanity had to transform Mars into a new home using the gifts given by the Singularity in time to survive as a test. They oppose the Holy Terra and Blessed Singularity faiths in their insistence that Mars is more important because Earth has become uninhabitable, meaning Martians are therefore superior to Earthlings. Living against the Terraformers Code could cause all colonists to die, giving the religion an apocalyptic fervor. They believe the terraforming machines must be preserved and reactivated before the atmosphere escapes, forcing them to proselytize and spread their faith through any means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
altered;Altered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
altered_desc;The Altered are an aggressive offshoot of Terraformed adherents which believes it is inevitable that the atmosphere will fade away, and so we must prepare and adapt. Trying to restore the terraforming machines is a dangerous waste of time. They eliminate or convert the unaltered who have no potential to survive the impending doom, and are thus a hinderance to humanity's chance of survival. Only the strong will survive and thrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
